Hexchat Scripts:
================

Scripts for Hexchat
- Whois Scanner (currently in development)
- Shaded Ignore: Display ignored users lines shaded instead of total ignore.


Big thanks to [cryzed](https://github.com/cryzed) who developed [HexChat-Mock](https://github.com/cryzed/HexChat-Mock) and helped me out installing his module in several editors which saved alot of time and effort while developing these scripts.
